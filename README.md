# Operational-Research-project
Two optimization problems in which we are looking for the minimum time


# The first problem:
A factory, among the various colors and related products it produces,
also produces five different special color shades (named: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) for
its large customers, for which demand is stable. Each such special shade arises
by a specific mixing machine which should be cleaned before its production
next (different) shade. The mixing process for each shade from 1 to 5
lasts 40, 35, 45, 32 and 50 minutes, respectively. The cleaning times of the above machine
they depend on both the type and the shade of the colors. For example, a color
that is based on oil requires more cleaning time than a paint that is based on it
water. Something similar happens when after a shade of dark color it should be produced
a shade of white. The cleaning time of the machine (in minutes) required so that the
machine to produce shade j given that the immediately preceding shade i was given
from element (i, j) of the table below.
